<h2> Design & Graphics</h2>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p> Design and graphics are what make a video game pleasing to look at and aesthetic. Players will play a game for longer if it looks good because it is pleasing to them. This artistic style can make a game iconic and its style more well known. Low quality art and graphics are not always a bad thing, though. A game that displays an iconic design is Minecraft. Its pixelated design and low quality graphics are iconoic to the game rather than seeming like a weakness. Some examples of games with great art and graphics are:</p>
<p> •God of War</p>
<p> •Cyberpunk 2077</p>
<p> •Red Dead Redemption 2</p>
